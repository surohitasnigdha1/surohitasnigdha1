## Hi there 👋, I am Surohita Snigdha Satrasala

I'm a passionate third-year engineering student with a solid foundation in front-end web development and databases, and a growing expertise in AI/LLM systems. I've recently been diving deep into projects involving LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

⚙️ I'm actively building practical, real-world AI tools and participating in hackathons (🏆 including 2 recent hackathon wins!) to sharpen my skills and solve problems that matter. I'm also a mentee in the Codess Cafe Mentorship Program, where I'm continuously growing through community and guidance.

Currently exploring:

🤖 LLMs & agent-based systems

🧠 LangChain, Retrieval pipelines

📌Strong in my ABC's: Always #ACTIVE,BUILDING,CAFFEINATED ☕.
